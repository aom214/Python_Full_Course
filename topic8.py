#scope of global variable:- The global variables are accessible only after defining them in python as python is a interpreter language it executes code line by line so a global variable can be accessible only after defining them..

# intepreter:- An interpreted language is one where the code is executed line by line by a program called an interpreter, instead of being compiled entirely into machine code first.



# When you run this file:

# The Python interpreter reads the first line → executes it → prints “Hello”

# Then it moves to the next line → executes it → prints 8

# If it finds an error, it stops immediately (it doesn’t continue)
